# Autonomous_Aerial_Mine_Detector
Landmines are the number one war leftover affecting not only military personnel, but also innocent civilians worldwide. The objective of this research project is to design a prototype that can assist military personnel in the operation of detecting landmines.  The parts that make up our prototype are Ground Penetrating Radar System (GPR) using two Vivaldi Antennas, a Software Defined Radio System (SDR) using  Realtek  RTL2832U,  and  finally  an  HJ  450  Drone  that  will  be  carrying  the components used for landmine detection. The GPR system uses Vivaldi antennas to send and receive signals to and from the ground, after that the SDR will process the signal from the receiver antenna. From the results generated we can conclude that; the system is feasible for detecting landmines from the air. However, we identified several improvements that can be made to optimize the system like for example using a more advanced SDR that has both transmitter and receiver functionality in order to obtain better sensitivity and using GNU Radio in Matlab to process received signals.
